# Spark AR Studio Filters

Spark AR Studio is a popular augmented reality (AR) platform that allows users to create filters, effects, and interactive experiences for use on social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger. In this repository I have included the Facebook and Instagram filters which is available in my instagram @dheerazsah. 

1. Hazy: The Hazy filter is an effect that adds a soft and dreamy look to photos or videos. It does this by decreasing the contrast and saturation while increasing the brightness and warmth of the image. This gives the photo or video a hazy, ethereal quality that is often used for fashion or beauty content.

2. B&W Noir: The B&W Noir filter is a black and white filter that adds a film noir-inspired look to photos or videos. It does this by increasing the contrast and reducing the brightness, creating deep shadows and bright highlights. This gives the photo or video a moody and dramatic look that is often used for artistic or edgy content.

Both of these filters are unique and can add a different look and feel to your Instagram content. The Hazy filter is great for creating a soft and dreamy aesthetic, while the B&W Noir filter is perfect for creating a moody and dramatic look. I hope this explanation helps you understand the effects of these filters!
